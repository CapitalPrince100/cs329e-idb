				<h2><b>Review by Gabriella Romero</b></h2>
				<p><span class="data-type">Full Review:</span>"I'll admit, I went into Ulele expecting great things. I'd heard my ex-husband and his brand new wife had them cater his new wedding (with his brand new wife). I made reservations for 1 at Ulele 2 weeks in advance because I have a lot of free time in my single life, and I'm able to think far in advance without a man on my mind. When the evening rolled around, I donned my new bonnet which I regained custody of, and took a taxi to the restaurant. I was seated at a table close to the animatronic singing pelican and placed my napkin in my lap. When the waitress came around I asked for: "1 Hawaiian Punch" because I only need onre drink for one person, but I was thoroughly dismayed that a fine restaurant like Ulele's didnt' have Hawaiian Punch. Fudrucker's wouldn't make this mistake!!! However, I rallied and ordered a glass of iced tea in its place. Then, I was starting to feel liberated and free all by my lonesome, so I ordered a bowl of ice cream for dinner. Only 1 bowl because I only need 1 for 1 person eating. Me. But I got overzealous and started ordering ice cream hand over fist. More MORE MORE!!!! My tab came out to well over a hundred dollars, but since I'm not spending money on my husband anymore, this wasn't a problem. I would strongly reccomend this specific experience to all those lonely souls out there." - 2/14/2017 </p>
